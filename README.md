This is a RESTful API service built with FastAPI that analyzes strings, 
computes key linguistic and technical properties, and stores the results in a persistent SQLite database. 

It fully implements features like duplicate checking (via SHA-256 hash), flexible filtering using standard query parameters, 
and advanced filtering using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This service was developed as part of the Backend Wizards ‚Äî Stage 1 Task.

 Features:  
The service is built around a single StringAnalysis resource and provides the following capabilities:

String Analysis: Automatically calculates six properties for any submitted string: 
length, is_palindrome, unique_characters, word_count, sha256_hash, and character_frequency_map.Deduplication: 
Uses the SHA-256 hash of the string as a unique identifier. 
Attempting to submit a string that already exists results in a 409 Conflict error.
Query Filtering (GET /strings): Supports filtering by string properties using standard query parameters 
(e.g., is_palindrome, min_length, max_length, min_word_count).Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) Filtering (GET /strings/filter-by-natural-language): 
Translates conversational English queries into structured API filters 
(e.g., "palindromes with a word count greater than one").
Persistence: Uses SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database file (analyzer.db) 
for persistent storage.

 Setup and Local RunPrerequisitesYou need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/karons101/string-analyzer-service.git
cd string-analyzer-service

2. Install Dependencies I used a virtual environment, Bash# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Installed the required packages
# Ensure I had the requirements.txt, or install them manually:
pip install fastapi uvicorn 'pydantic[email]' sqlalchemy

The service uses the SHA-256 hash of the string as its primary identifier for retrieval and deletion.
